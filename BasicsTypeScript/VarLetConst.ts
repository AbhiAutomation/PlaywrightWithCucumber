/**
 * . const (Constant)
const is used to declare variables whose reference cannot be reassigned once declared.

Reassignment: The binding is immutable. You cannot assign a new value to the const variable.

Block Scope: It's scoped to the nearest pair of curly braces ({})‚Äîlike an if block, for loop, or function.

Deep Concept: Object Mutability: While you cannot reassign a const object or array, you can still mutate its content.

//console.log(color); // Output: undefined
// üëÜ The compiler sees this as: var color; console.log(color);

//var color = "blue"; 

// The code is conceptually treated as:
// var color; // Hoisted and set to undefined
 //console.log(color); // Logs undefined
// color = "blue";
  
let city = "London";


// This period is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
console.log(city); // ‚ùå ReferenceError: Cannot access 'city' before initialization


// The compiler knows 'city' exists, but it hasn't finished setting it up yet.
// If you try to access it during the TDZ, it throws a strict error,
// which is much better than getting the confusing `undefined` value from `var`.

/**There are indeed two primary types of scope that determine the visibility and lifetime of your variables: Function Scope and Block Scope.


Function Scope (Legacy)
Function scope means a variable is accessible anywhere within the function it was declared in, regardless of whether it was inside a code block (like an if statement or a for loop).

Keyword: var

Boundary: The variable's boundary is the entire function body ({ ... }).

Behavior: Variables declared with var are "leaky" because they ignore smaller blocks.
