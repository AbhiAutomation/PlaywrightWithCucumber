Why Typescript language -->  additonaly Features in Typescript


Why javascript (Es3,Es4 ,ES5, ES6) programing languae should follow soome standard 
ES - ECMAScript :  is the standard to which all javascript code must comply just like W3C follow all web browser applications
If you want to add features in existing in  ES 6  but thos  feature is not complince  ECMAScript then  we can not add those featue 
It should follow all ES 
 A vendor as microsoft can not  add feature to the javascript without breaking ECMAScript complince 
microsoft  add  some feartre whic is not follow ECMAScript standard 
that gives microsoft all the  freediome  in the worls to make TypeScriptas feure full  as any othr programing langauege

So microsoft is got created Typescript on top of javascript itself  thahs why reason superset  of javascript 

Typescript is superset of javascript
TypeScript  supported all opps concept  but javascript not 
so Typescript haivng data type and statically type language and all the object
 advance feture gnercks and collection  thats why typescript over javcript  

Microsoft create  thats why compatibility
